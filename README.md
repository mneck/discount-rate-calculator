Present Value is the current value of a future sum of money at a specific rate of return. To put it simply, money not spent today may lose value in the future owing to the inflation rate or the rate of return has the money been invested. So, the present value concept suggests that money is worth more now than in the future.

A discount rate is the rate of return for calculating the present value. In simple words, it is the rate of return that an investor forgoes by accepting an amount in the future. So, the discount rate is the expected return that an investor would have got if he had invested the current amount of money for some time.

Value for calculating the present value is PV = FV* [1/ (1 + i)^n]. Here i is the discount rate and n is the period. A point to note is that the PV table represents the part of the PV formula in bold above [1/ (1 + i)^n]. Many also call it a present value factor.

For example, we need to calculate the PV of $1000 at 5% discount rate and over two years. Putting the values in the formula, $1000*[1/(1+5%)^2] or $1000*0.907 or $907. Here 0.907 is the coefficient.
